Student Details and document verification through Blockchain

# Abstract

Document verification is a complex domain that involves various challenging and tedious
processes to authenticate. Moreover various types of documents for instance banking documents,
government documents, transaction documents, educational certificates etc. might involve
customized verification and authentication practices. The content for each type varies significantly,
hence requires to be dealt in a distinct manner. For students, educational certificates are the most
important documents issued by their universities. However, as the issuing process is not that
transparent and verifiable, fake certificates can be easily created. A skillfully generated fake
certificate is always hard to detect and can be treated as the original. Blockchain technology has
recently emerged as a potential means for authenticating the document verification process and a
significant tool to combat document fraud and misuse. This research aimed to enhance the
document verification process using blockchain technology. In this research, authors have
identified the security themes required for document verification in the blockchain. This research
also identifies the gaps and loopholes in the current blockchain based educational certificate
verification solutions. At the end, a blockchain based framework for verifying educational
certificates focusing on themes including authentication, authorization, confidentiality, privacy and
ownership is proposed using the Ethereum Framework.
